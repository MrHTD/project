            Muslims are people who adhere to Islam, an Abrahamic religion. They consider the Quran, the central
            religious text of Islam, to be the verbatim word of the God of Abraham as it was revealed to Muhammad, the main Islamic prophet and
            messenger. The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (sunnah) as recorded in traditional accounts (hadith).
            <br><br>
            Islam is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity, with about more than 1.8 billion
            Muslims worldwide. Although its roots go back further, scholars typically date the creation of Islam to the 7th
            century, making it the youngest of the major world religions. Islam started in Mecca, in modern-day Saudi
            Arabia, during the time of the prophet Muhammad’s life. Today, the faith is spreading rapidly throughout the
            world.
            <br><br>
            Muslims are the overwhelming majority in Central Asia, the majority in the
            Caucasus and widespread in Southeast Asia. India is the country with the largest Muslim population outside
            Muslim-majority countries. Sizeable Muslim communities are also found in the Americas, China, and throughout
            Europe. Islam is the fastest-growing major religion in the world.</p>

          <h5><b>Islamic New Year</b></h5>
          The Islamic New Year also called the Hijri New Year or
          Arabic New Year, is the day that marks the beginning of a new lunar Hijri year, and is the day on which the
          year count is incremented. The first day of the Islamic year is observed by most Muslims on the first day of
          the month of Muharram. The epoch (reference date) of the Islamic era was set as 622 Common Era (CE), the year
          of the emigration of muhammad(SAW) and his followers from Mecca to Medina, known as the Hijra. All
          religious duties, such as prayer, fasting in the month of Ramadan, and pilgrimage, and the dates of
          significant events, such as celebration of holy nights and festivals, are calculated according to the Islamic
          calendar.
          While some Islamic organizations prefer determining the new month (and hence the new year) by local sightings
          of the moon, most Islamic institutions and countries, including Saudi Arabia, follow astronomical
          calculations to determine future dates of the Islamic calendar. There are various schemas for calculating the
          tabular Islamic calendar (i.e. not based on observation), which results in differences of typically one or
          even two days between countries using such schema and those that use lunar sightings. For example, the Umm
          al-Qura calendar used in Saudi Arabia was reformed several times in recent years. The current scheme was
          introduced in 1423 AH (15 March 2002).
          A day in the Islamic calendar is defined as beginning at sunset. For example, 1 Muharram 1432 was defined to
          correspond to 7 or 8 December 2010 in civil calendars (depending on the country). For an observation-based
          calendar, a sighting of the new moon at sunset of 6 December would mean that 1 Muharram lasted from the moment
          of sunset of 6 December to the moment of sunset of 7 December, while in places where the new moon was not
          sighted on 6 December 1 Muharram would last from the moment of sunset of 7 December to the moment of sunset of
          8 December.

          <h5><b>Eid al-Fitr</b></h5>
          Eid al-Fitr 'Feast of Breaking the
          Fast' is the earlier of the two official holidays celebrated within Islam (the
          other being Eid al-Adha). The religious holiday is celebrated by Muslims worldwide because it marks the end of
          the month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramadan. It falls on the first day of Shawwal in the Islamic
          calendar; this does not always fall on the same Gregorian day, as the start of any lunar Hijri month varies
          based on when the new moon is sighted by local religious authorities. The holiday is known under various other
          names in different languages and countries around the world. The day is also called Lesser Eid, or simply
          Eid.
          Eid al-Fitr has a particular salat (Islamic prayer) that consists of two rakats (units) generally performed in
          an open field or large hall. It may only be performed in congregation (jamāʿat) and features six additional
          Takbirs (raising of the hands to the ears while saying "Allāhu ʾAkbar", meaning "God is the greatest") in the
          Hanafi school of Sunni Islam: three at the start of the first rakat and three just before rukūʿ in the second
          rakat. Other Sunni schools usually have 12 Takbirs, similarly split in groups of seven and five. In Shia
          Islam, the salat has six Takbirs in the first rakat at the end of qira'a, before rukūʿ, and five in the
          second. Depending on the juristic opinion of the locality, this salat is either farḍ (فرض, obligatory),
          mustaḥabb (strongly recommended) or mandūb (مندوب, preferable). After the salat, Muslims celebrate the Eid
          al-Fitr in various ways with food ("Eid cuisine") being a central theme, which also gives the holiday the
          nickname "Sweet Eid" or "Sugar Feast".

          <h5><b>Eid al-Adha</b></h5>
          Eid al-Adha is the latter of the
          two official holidays which are celebrated within Islam (the other being Eid al-Fitr). It honors the
          willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael) as an act of obedience to Allah's
          command. Before Ibrahim could sacrifice his son, however, God provided him with a lamb which he was supposed
          to kill in his son's place. In commemoration of this intervention, animals are ritually slaughtered. One third
          of their meat is consumed by the family which offers the animal, while the rest of the meat is distributed to
          the poor and the needy. Sweets and gifts are given, and extended family members are typically visited and
          welcomed. The day is also sometimes called Big Eid or the Greater Eid.

          In the Islamic lunar calendar, Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah and lasts for four days. In
          the international (Gregorian) calendar, the dates vary from year to year, shifting approximately 11 days
          earlier each year.
