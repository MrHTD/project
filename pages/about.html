          <h3 class="mb-3"><b>Festivals</b></h3>
          A festival is an event ordinarily celebrated by a community and centering on some characteristic aspect of
          that community and its religion or cultures. It is often marked as a local or national holiday, mela, or
          eid. A festival constitutes typical cases of glocalization, as well as the high culture-low culture
          interrelationship.[1] Next to religion and folklore, a significant origin is agricultural. Food is such a
          vital resource that many festivals are associated with harvest time. Religious commemoration and
          thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn, such as Halloween in the
          northern hemisphere and Easter in the southern.

          Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or
          thanking to the gods, goddesses or saints: they're called patronal festivals. They may also provide
          entertainment, which was particularly important to local communities before the advent of mass-produced
          entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform community members of
          their traditions; the involvement of elders sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity among
          families.

          In Ancient Greece and Rome, festivals such as the Saturnalia were closely associated with social
          organisation and political processes as well as religion.

          <h3 class="my-4 text-center"><b>Types of festivals</b></h3>
          <h5 class="text-start">Religious festivals:</h5>
          <p class="text-start">
          Among many religions, a feast is a set of celebrations in honour of God or gods. A feast and a festival
          are historically interchangeable. Most religions have festivals that recur annually and some, such as
          Passover, Easter and Eid al-Adha are moveable feasts â€“ that is, those that are determined either by lunar or
          agricultural cycles or the calendar in use at the time. The Sed festival, for example, celebrated the
          thirtieth year of an Egyptian pharaoh's rule and then every three (or four in one case) years after
          that. Among the Ashantis, most of their traditional festivals are linked to gazette sites which are
          believed to be sacred with several rich biological resources in their pristine forms. Thus, the annual
          commemoration of the festivals helps in maintaining the buoyancy of the conserved natural site, assisting in
          biodiversity conservation.

          In the Christian liturgical calendar, there are two principal feasts, properly known as the Feast of the
          Nativity of our Lord (Christmas) and the Feast of the Resurrection (Easter), but minor festivals in honour
          of local patron saints are celebrated in almost all countries influenced by Christianity. In the Catholic,
          Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican liturgical calendars there are a great number of lesser feasts throughout the
          year commemorating saints, sacred events or doctrines. In the Philippines, each day of the year has at least
          one specific religious festival, either from Catholic, Islamic, or indigenous origins.[citation needed]

          Buddhist religious festivals, such as Esala Perahera are held in Sri Lanka and Thailand. Hindu
          festivals, such as Holi are very ancient. The Sikh community celebrates the Vaisakhi festival marking the
          new year and birth of the Khalsa.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-start">Arts festivals:</h5>
          <p class="text-start">Among the many offspring of general arts festivals are also more specific types of festivals, including
            ones that showcase intellectual or creative achievement such as science festivals, literary festivals and
            music festivals. Sub-categories include comedy festivals, rock festivals, jazz festivals and buskers
            festivals; poetry festivals, theatre festivals, and storytelling festivals; and re-enactment festivals
            such as Renaissance fairs. In the Philippines, aside from numerous art festivals scattered throughout the
            year, February is known as national arts month, the culmination of all art festivals in the entire
            archipelago.

            Film festivals involve the screenings of several different films, and are usually held annually. Some of the
            most significant film festivals include the Berlin International Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival and
            the Cannes Film Festival. With the increasing importance of digitalization, one of the online film festival
            is Best Istanbul Film Festival.</p>
          <h5 class="text-start mb-3">Seasonal and harvest festivals:</h5>
          <p class="text-start">Seasonal festivals, such as Beltane, are determined by the solar and the lunar calendars and by the cycle
            of the seasons, especially because of its effect on food supply, as a result of which there is a wide range
            of ancient and modern harvest festivals. Ancient Egyptians relied upon the seasonal inundation caused by the
            Nile River, a form of irrigation, which provided fertile land for crops.[24] In the Alps, in autumn the
            return of the cattle from the mountain pastures to the stables in the valley is celebrated as Almabtrieb. A
            recognized winter festival, the Chinese New Year, is set by the lunar calendar, and celebrated from the day
            of the second new moon after the winter solstice. Dree Festival of the Apatanis living in Lower Subansiri
            District of Arunachal Pradesh is celebrated every year from July 4 to 7 by praying for a bumper crop
            harvest.[25]

            Midsummer or St John's Day, is an example of a seasonal festival, related to the feast day of a Christian
            saint as well as a celebration of the time of the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, where it is
            particularly important in Sweden. Winter carnivals also provide the opportunity to utilise to celebrate
            creative or sporting activities requiring snow and ice. In the Philippines, each day of the year has at
            least one festival dedicated to harvesting of crops, fishes, crustaceans, milk, and other local goods.</p>
