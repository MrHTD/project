            Sikhism or Sikhi is a religion that originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent, present-day
            Pakistan, around the end of the 15th century CE. It is the most recently founded major organized faith, and
            stands at fifth-largest worldwide with about 25–30 million adherents (known as Sikhs) as of the early
            21st century.
            <br><br>
            Symbol of Sikhism developed from the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak (1469–1539), the faith's first guru, of the
            nine Sikh gurus who succeeded him. The tenth guru, Gobind Singh (1666–1708), named the Sikh scripture Guru
            Granth Sahib as his successor, bringing to a close the line of human gurus and establishing the scripture as
            the 11th and last eternally living guru, a religious spiritual/life guide for Sikhs.
            <br><br>
            Guru Nanak taught that living an "active, creative, and practical life" of "truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity" is
            above metaphysical truth, and that the ideal man "establishes union with God, knows His Will, and carries
            out that Will". Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru (1606–1644), established the concept of mutual
            co-existence of the miri ('political'/'temporal') and piri ('spiritual') realms.

          <h5><b>Baisakhi</b></h5>
          Vaisakhi , also pronounced Baisakhi, marks the first day of the month of Vaisakh and is
          traditionally celebrated annually on 13 April as a celebration of spring harvest primarily in Northern
          India. Further, other Indian cultures and diaspora celebrate this festival too. Whilst it is
          culturally significant as a festival of harvest, some also consider Vaisakhi to be the legitimate date for the
          Indian Solar New Year. However, it is important to understand that this isn’t a universally accepted belief,
          with some individuals considering the previous month of Chet the New Year.

          For Sikhs, in addition to its significance as the harvest festival, during which Sikhs hold kirtans, visit
          local Gurdwaras, community fairs, hold nagar kirtan processions, raise the Nishan Sahib flag, and gather to
          socialize and share festive foods, Vaisakhi observes major events in the history of Sikhism and the
          Indian subcontinent that happened in the Punjab region. Vaisakhi as a major Sikh festival marks the
          birth of the Khalsa order by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of Sikhism, on March 30th 1699.
          Later, Ranjit Singh was proclaimed as Maharaja of the Sikh Empire on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with
          Vaisakhi), creating a unified political state, Vaisakhi was also the day when Bengal Army officer Reginald
          Dyer orders his troops to shoot into a protesting crowd, an event which would come to be known the Jallianwala
          Bagh massacre; the massacre proved influential to the history of the Indian independence movement.

          This holiday also is known as Vaisakha Sankranti, based on the Hindu Vikram Samvat calendar, and is known by
          various regional names in other parts of India. For many Hindu communities, the festival is an occasion to
          ritually bathe in sacred rivers such as Ganges, Jhelum, and Kaveri, visit temples, meet friends, take part in
          other festivities, and perform a mandatory daan (charity) especially of hand fans, water pitchers and seasonal
          fruits. Community fairs are held at Hindu pilgrimage sites. In many areas, processions of temple deities
          are taken out.

          <h5><b>Guru Nanak</b></h5>
          Gurū Nānak born as Nānak on 15 April
          1469 – 22 September 1539), also referred to as Bābā Nānak (father Nānak), was the founder of Sikhism and
          is the first of the ten Sikh Gurus. His birth is celebrated worldwide as Guru Nanak Gurpurab on Katak
          Pooranmashi ('full-moon of Kattak'), i.e. October–November.

          Nanak is said to have travelled far and wide across Asia teaching people the message of ik onkar (ੴ, 'one
          God'), who dwells in every one of his creations and constitutes the eternal Truth.[2] With this concept, he
          would set up a unique spiritual, social, and political platform based on equality, fraternal love, goodness,
          and virtue.

          Nanak's words are registered in the form of 974 poetic hymns, or shabda, in the holy text of Sikhism, the Guru
          Granth Sahib, with some of the major prayers being the Japji Sahib (jap, 'to recite'; ji and sahib are
          suffixes signifying respect); the Asa di Var ('ballad of hope'); and the Sidh Gosht ('discussion with the
          Siddhas'). It is part of Sikh religious belief that the spirit of Nanak's sanctity, divinity, and religious
          authority had descended upon each of the nine subsequent Gurus when the Guruship was devolved on to them.

            Nepal. On the other hand, in the sidereal solar Bengali calendar and Assamese calendar, a Sankranti is

            Punjab region, Pana Sankranti in Odisha, Jude Sheetal in Mithila region of Bihar and on the day after Mesha
