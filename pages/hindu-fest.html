            The term "Hindu" trace back to Old Persian which derived these names from the Sanskrit name Sindhu (सिन्धु
            ), referring to the river Indus. The Greek cognates of the same terms are "Indus" (for the river) and
            "India" (for the land of the river). The term "Hindu" also implied a geographic, ethnic or cultural
            identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu (Indus) River. By the
            16th century CE, the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims.
            Hindoo is an archaic spelling variant, whose use today may be considered derogatory.
            <br><br>
            Hinduism is the world’s oldest religion, according to many scholars, with roots and customs dating back more
            than 4,000 years. Today, with about 900 million followers, Hinduism is the third-largest religion behind
            Christianity and Islam. Roughly 95 percent of the world’s Hindus live in India. Because the religion has no
            specific founder, it’s difficult to trace its origins and history. Hinduism is unique in that it’s not a
            single religion but a compilation of many traditions and philosophies.

          <h5><b>Holi</b></h5>
          Holi is a popular ancient Hindu festival, also known as the Festival of Spring, the
          Festival of Colours or the Festival of Love. The festival celebrates the eternal and divine love of
          Radha Krishna. It also signifies the triumph of good over evil, as it celebrates the victory
          of Lord Vishnu as Narasimha Narayana over Hiranyakashipu. It originated and is predominantly
          celebrated in the Indian subcontinent but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western
          world through the South Asian diaspora.

          Holi celebrates the arrival of spring, the end of winter, the blossoming of love and for many, it is a festive
          day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships. The festival
          is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season. It lasts for a night and a day, starting on
          the evening of the Purnima (Full Moon Day) falling in the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around
          the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar. The first evening is known as Holika Dahan (burning of Demon
          Holika) or Chhoti Holi and the following day as Holi, Rangwali Holi, Dol Purnima, Dhuleti, Dhulandi,
          Ukuli, Manjal Kuli, Yaosang, Shigmo or Phagwah, Jajiri.

          Holi is an Ancient Indian religious festival that has also become popular outside of India. In addition to
          India and Nepal, the festival is celebrated by South Asian diaspora in countries such as Suriname, Guyana,
          Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, South Africa, Mauritius, Fiji, Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the
          United States, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The festival has spread to parts
          of Europe and North America as a spring celebration of love, frolic, and colours.

          Holi celebrations start on the night before Holi with a Holika Dahan where people gather, perform religious
          rituals in front of the bonfire, and pray that their internal evil be destroyed the way Holika, the sister of
          the demon king Hiranyakashipu, was killed in the fire. The next morning is celebrated as Rangwali Holi
          (Dhuleti) – a free-for-all festival of colours, where people smear each other with colours and drench each
          other. Water guns and water-filled balloons are also used to play and colour each other. Anyone and everyone
          is fair game, friend or stranger, rich or poor, man or woman, children, and elders. The frolic and fight with
          colours occurs in the open streets, parks, outside temples and buildings. Groups carry drums and other musical
          instruments, go from place to place, sing and dance. People visit family, friends and foes come together to
          throw coloured powders on each other, laugh and gossip, then share Holi delicacies, food and drinks.
          In the evening, people dress up and visit friends and family.

          <h5><b>Diwali</b></h5>
          Diwali or Divali; related to Jain Diwali, Bandi Chhor Divas,
          Tihar, Swanti, Sohrai and Bandna) is a festival of lights and one of the major festivals celebrated by Hindus,
          Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. The festival usually lasts five days and is celebrated during the Hindu
          lunisolar month Kartika (between mid-October and mid-November). One of the most popular festivals of
          Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over
          ignorance". The festival is widely associated with Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, with many
          other regional traditions connecting the holiday to Sita and Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Yama, Yami, Durga, Kali,
          Hanuman, Ganesha, Kubera, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. Furthermore, it is, in some regions, a celebration of
          the day Rama returned to his kingdom Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating
          Ravana in Lanka and serving 14 years of exile.

          In the lead-up to Diwali, celebrants will prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and
          workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colorful art circle patterns). During Diwali, people wear
          their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with diyas and rangoli, perform
          worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth,[note 1] light fireworks, and partake in
          family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared. Diwali is also a major cultural event for the
          Hindu, Sikh and Jain diaspora.

          The five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts.
          Diwali is usually celebrated twenty days after the Vijayadashami (Dussehra, Dasara, Dasain) festival, with
          Dhanteras, or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of the festival when celebrants prepare by
          cleaning their homes and making decorations on the floor, such as rangolis. The second day is Naraka
          Chaturdashi. The third day is the day of Lakshmi Puja and the darkest night of the traditional month. In some
          parts of India, the day after Lakshmi Puja is marked with the Govardhan Puja and Balipratipada (Padwa). Some
          Hindu communities mark the last day as Bhai Dooj or the regional equivalent, which is dedicated to the bond
          between sister and brother, while other Hindu and Sikh craftsmen communities mark this day as Vishwakarma
          Puja and observe it by performing maintenance in their work spaces and offering prayers.

          Some other faiths in India also celebrate their respective festivals alongside Diwali. The Jains observe their
          own Diwali which marks the final liberation of Mahavira, the Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark
          the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal Empire prison, while Newar Buddhists, unlike other Buddhists,
          celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi, while the Hindus of Eastern India and Bangladesh generally celebrate
          Diwali by worshipping the goddess Kali. The main day of the festival of Diwali (the day of Lakshmi
          Puja) is an official holiday in Fiji, Guyana, India, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar,
          Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.

          <h5><b>Onam</b></h5>
          Onam is an annual Hindu harvest festival celebrated in the
          Indian state of Kerala. A major annual event for Keralites, it is the official festival of the
          state and includes a spectrum of cultural events. Drawing from Hindu mythology, Onam
          commemorates King Mahabali and Vamana.

          Within the textual tradition (primarily Mahabharata), Mahabali is noted to be an Asura, who found liberation
          at the feet of Vishnu through charity and religious rectitude. However, there are other interpretations of
          the same myth-cycle. In the state-sanctioned celebrations, Mahabali is portrayed as a cultural hero: a
          just and benevolent ruler, he chose to even give up his rule/life for protecting his subjects, and was allowed
          by Vamana to return once a year.

          The festival probably has ancient origins and it became intricately linked with Hindu legends at some later
          date. The earliest known reference is found in Maturaikkāñci – a Sangam poem – which mentions Onam
          being celebrated in Madurai temples. Since then, multiple temple inscriptions record celebrations of
          Onam. The date is based on the Panchangam which falls on the 22nd nakshatra Thiruvonam in the month
          Chingam of Malayalam calendar, which in Gregorian calendar falls between August–September.
