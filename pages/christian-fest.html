            Christians are people who follow or adhere to Christianity, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion based on the
            life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The words Christ and Christian derive from the Koine Greek title
            Christós (Χριστός), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term mashiach (usually rendered as
            messiah in English).
            <br><br>
            While there are diverse interpretations of Christianity which sometimes conflict, they
            are united in believing that Jesus has a unique significance. The term Christian used as an adjective is
            descriptive of anything associated with Christianity or Christian churches, or in a proverbial sense "all
            that is noble, and good, and Christ-like." It does not have a meaning of 'of Christ' or 'related or
            pertaining to Christ'.
            <br><br>
            Christianity is the most widely practiced religion in the world, with more than 2 billion followers. The
            Christian faith centers on beliefs regarding the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. While
            it started with a small group of adherents, many historians regard the spread and adoption of Christianity
            throughout the world as one of the most successful spiritual missions in human history.

          <h5><b>Christmas</b></h5>
          Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25
          as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to
          the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the
          season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night.
          Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of
          Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday
          season organized around it.

          The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that
          Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the
          city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels
          proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word.

          There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus' birth and in the early fourth century, the church
          fixed the date as December 25. This corresponds to the date of the winter solstice on the Roman
          calendar. It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of the spring equinox.
          Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally
          in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches
          celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in
          the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for
          the sins of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus' exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in
          celebrating Christmas.

          The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian,
          and secular themes and origins. Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving; completing an
          Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of
          Christmas cards; church services; a special meal; and the display of various Christmas decorations, including
          Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. In addition,
          several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint
          Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have
          their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas
          festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales
          period for retailers and businesses. Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing
          economic effect in many regions of the world.

          <h5><b>Easter</b></h5>
          Easter, also called Pascha (Aramaic, Greek, Latin) or Resurrection Sunday, is a Christian
          festival and cultural holiday commemorating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, described in the New
          Testament as having occurred on the third day of his burial following his crucifixion by the Romans at Calvary
          c. 30 AD. It is the culmination of the Passion of Jesus, preceded by Lent (or Great Lent), a 40-day
          period of fasting, prayer, and penance.

          Most Christians refer to the week before Easter as Holy Week, which in Western Christianity contains the days
          of the Easter Triduum including Maundy Thursday, commemorating the Maundy and Last Supper, as well as
          Good Friday, commemorating the crucifixion and death of Jesus. In Eastern Christianity, the same days and
          events are commemorated with the names of days all starting with "Holy" or "Holy and Great;" and Easter itself
          might be called "Great and Holy Pascha", "Easter Sunday," "Pascha" or "Sunday of Pascha." In Western
          Christianity, Eastertide, or the Easter Season, begins on Easter Sunday and lasts seven weeks, ending with the
          coming of the 50th day, Pentecost Sunday. In Eastern Christianity, the Paschal season ends with Pentecost as
          well, but the leave-taking of the Great Feast of Pascha is on the 39th day, the day before the Feast of the
          Ascension.

          Easter and its related holidays are moveable feasts, not falling on a fixed date; its date is computed based
          on a lunisolar calendar (solar year plus Moon phase) similar to the Hebrew calendar. The First Council of
          Nicaea (325) established only two rules, namely independence from the Hebrew calendar and worldwide
          uniformity. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that
          took centuries and generated a number of controversies. It has come to be the first Sunday after the
          ecclesiastical full moon that occurs on or soonest after 21 March. Even if calculated on the basis of the
          more accurate Gregorian calendar, the date of that full moon sometimes differs from that of the astronomical
          first full moon after the March equinox.

          Easter is linked to the Jewish Passover by its name (Hebrew: פֶּסַח pesach, Aramaic: פָּסחָא pascha are the
          basis of the term Pascha), by its origin (according to the synoptic Gospels, both the crucifixion and the
          resurrection took place during the Passover) and by much of its symbolism, as well as by its position
          in the calendar. In most European languages the feast is called by the words for passover in those languages;
          and in the older English versions of the Bible the term Easter was the term used to translate passover.

          Easter customs vary across the Christian world, and include sunrise services, midnight vigils, exclamations
          and exchanges of Paschal greetings, clipping the church (England), decoration and the communal breaking of
          Easter eggs (a symbol of the empty tomb). The Easter lily, a symbol of the resurrection in Western
          Christianity, traditionally decorates the chancel area of churches on this day and for the rest of
          Eastertide. Additional customs that have become associated with Easter and are observed by both Christians
          and some non-Christians include Easter parades, communal dancing (Eastern Europe), the Easter Bunny and egg
          hunting. There are also traditional Easter foods that vary by region and culture.

          <h5><b>Epiphany</b></h5>
          Epiphany, also known as Theophany in Eastern Christian traditions, is a Christian
          feast day that celebrates the revelation (theophany) of God incarnate as Jesus Christ.

          In Western Christianity, the feast commemorates principally (but not solely) the visit of the Magi to the
          Christ Child, and thus Jesus Christ's physical manifestation to the Gentiles. It is sometimes called
          Three Kings' Day, and in some traditions celebrated as Little Christmas. Moreover, the feast of the
          Epiphany, in some denominations, also initiates the liturgical season of Epiphanytide.

          Eastern Christians, on the other hand, commemorate the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River, seen as his
          manifestation to the world as the Son of God. The spot marked by Al-Maghtas in Jordan, adjacent to Qasr
          al-Yahud in the West Bank, is considered to be the original site of the baptism of Jesus and the ministry of
          John the Baptist.

          The traditional date for the feast is January 6. However, since 1970, the celebration is held in some
          countries on the Sunday after January 1. Those Eastern Churches which are still following the Julian calendar
          observe the feast on what, according to the internationally used Gregorian calendar, is January 19,
          because of the current 13-day difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.

          In many Western Churches, the eve of the feast is celebrated as Twelfth Night (Epiphany Eve). The
          Monday after Epiphany is known as Plough Monday.

          Popular Epiphany customs include Epiphany singing, chalking the door, having one's house blessed, consuming
          Three Kings Cake, winter swimming, as well as attending church services. It is customary for Christians in
          many localities to remove their Christmas decorations on Epiphany Eve (Twelfth Night), although those in
          other Christian countries historically remove them on Candlemas, the conclusion of Epiphanytide.
          According to the first tradition, those who fail to remember to remove their Christmas decorations on Epiphany
          Eve must leave them untouched until Candlemas, the second opportunity to remove them; failure to observe this
          custom is considered inauspicious.
